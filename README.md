**Hi! I'm Brian Soriano, and I'm 16 years old.**

I’m passionate about graphic design, which is my strong suit. I love combining creativity with technical skills to bring ideas to life visually.
I’ve also worked with several programming languages, including C#, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, which allow me to create dynamic and functional web designs.

Currently, I’m studying Computer Science, where I continue to deepen my understanding of both design and coding, 
and I'm excited to explore how these two fields can come together to create innovative solutions.
* **I am interested in Web designing, graphic designing, and digital marketing**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  - php
  - c#
  - Java Script
- 👯 I’m looking forward to collaborate on open source projects.
- ✔ Ask me about anything, I am happy to help, only if the ball is in my court!😉<br>
- Outside tech, 🏍️ I love to ride motorcycles, 🏎️ i love cars and 🎵 listen to music.
